## Description :pen:

The Simple Note Taker application allows the user to record and save notes or remove as needed.

Application Features:

- Simple User Interface for easy navigation
- Minimal design for ease of use
- Save recorded notes or remove as needed


## Challenges :ocean:

 - Making sure I had all the necessary functions to execute the application. 

 - Debuging and cleaning up code. Assessing areas of code that wasn't functioning and applying the corrections

 - The note delete function became a problem, I wasn't able to remove any notes
